# AI Literacy: Verified Fact vs. Claim

**Module 0: Foundations**

**Learning Objectives:**
- Explain why a verified fact and an AI-generated claim differ
- Name 2 concrete risks of trusting unverified AI output
- State a personal rule for when to double-check AI output

## Scenario

You ask an AI tool a factual question about your data, and it answers confidently - but confident isn't the same as correct. Today you'll practice telling a verified fact apart from an AI-generated claim, and build a personal rule for when you stop and double-check before you trust what it told you.

*Reminder: type the commands inside the shaded code blocks below into your own terminal.*

## Before You Run an AI-Suggested Command

*⚠️ Not auto-validated: This slide is deliberately never meant to be run, live or automated - a destructive rm -rf shown specifically as an example NOT to execute, per its own notes.*

*Context: rm -rf deletes a folder and everything inside it permanently, with no confirmation prompt and no undo.*

```bash
# an AI assistant suggested this command - READ
# it fully and understand it BEFORE running it
$ rm -rf old_data/
```

## A Safe One: Check Before You Trust

*Context: wc -l is read-only and reversible-by-default — a much lower-stakes command to practice the same approve/reject habit on.*

**AI Mode:** Try Without AI

*Complete the TODOs below as you work through this step.*

```bash
# TODO: count the file's rows to double-check the AI's claim
wc -l ../../data/energy_sample.csv
```

## Verify Against the Real File

*Context: This is literally the verification step — running the real command yourself instead of trusting a claim about the file.*

**AI Mode:** Try Without AI

*Complete the TODOs below as you work through this step.*

```bash
# TODO: count the file's rows
# TODO: look at the actual header row
```
